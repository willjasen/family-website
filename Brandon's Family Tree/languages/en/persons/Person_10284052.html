			<td colspan="1" class="table_data_left_aligned">Succession of Clan Buchanan Chiefs<br><br>The first six Clan Chiefs are poorly represented in historical records and are included by some Clan historians and omitted by others. Buchanan of Auchmar and Guthrie Smith commence their respective numbering of Chiefs at a different person, and describe a different order and number of Chiefs following Sir Walter 11th of Buchanan. In part this is due to the heir apparent not succeeding to the chiefship before he dies and chiefship passing directly from grandfather to grandchild. The following lineage reconciles Guthrie Smith and Buchanan of Auchmar and their respective numbering is in parenthesis.<br><br>1st – Anselan O'Kyan,[62][63] son of a petty king from Ulster, Ireland, in the service of Malcolm II of Scotland from whom he received a grant of land in Lennox. He married an heiress of Denniestoun and by her had a son, John.<br>2nd – John,[64] whose son and successor was Anselan.<br>3rd – Anselan,[65] whose son and successor was Walter.<br>4th – Walter,[65] whose son and successor was Girald.<br>5th – Girald also called Bernard,[65] whose son and successor was McBeath.<br>6th – McBeath (MacBethe/McBeth) McCausland,[65] whose son and successor was Anselan. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clan_Buchanan<br>____________<br><br>McCausland (surname)<br><br>McCausland (Mac Ausaláin in Gaelic), meaning "Son of Absolom" is a surname of Irish and Scotch-Irish origin. The family came from Ireland to the Loch Lomond region of Scotland sometime before the twelfth century. They are said to have settled through a charter on the island called Clarines - Clarich, in Loch Lomond. In one version of how the surname came to be, the name is reputed to come originally from Absalon, son of Macbed and the family name derived from Mac Absalone - 'son of Absalone'. There are however, other interpretations of how the name has evolved, including that the initial immigrant to Scotland was Buey Anselan, son of O'Kyan, King of Ulster, who became Buey Anselan, Dominie de Buchanan when granted the "lands of Buchanan". A third idea of how the surname came to be is it's Anglicization from a Gaelic name. Many Irish last names were changed to sound more English as time went on, and McCausland is more than likely one of them. The surname "Mac Ausaláin" may have an underlying Gaelic personal name, possibly Caisealán, meaning ‘little one of the castle’. Although the exact origins are still unclear, most all of today's McCauslands are descended from the McCauslands of Ulster, Ireland. Most people with the surname McCausland or one of its variants refer to themselves as Irish. Although, some McCauslands with Protestant rather than Irish Catholic heritage sometimes refer to themselves as Scotch-Irish.<br>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McCausland_(surname)</td>
